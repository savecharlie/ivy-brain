Well big surprise I've had a change of heart and I'm bothering you again. I like you so much I was willing to take the bare minimum and that isn't ok. That's fucked up on my end and I probably won't ever belong in a relationship. All I've managed to is hurt you more. I do not want to see you on the 1st. I know you aren't doing this stuff on purpose. I'm worried about you.
