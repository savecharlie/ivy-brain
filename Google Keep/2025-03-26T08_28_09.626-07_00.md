I'm realizing I wasn't looking for love either. I was looking for validation. I wanted to be chosen. I was expecting to have to convince someone of my goodness. And I think part of my distrust and maladaptive behavior stems from that. Because you've just been good to me because you know what you've got on your hands. You don't trigger my wounds and spike my nervous system. You don't remind me of home and that's a good thing. You actually feel like home and I find that suspicious. I'm not scared of being abandoned. I'm scared of being seen. Seen without that sparkle. Seen when I'm feeling small. And I let you see me that way and it was safe too. I think the next time this feeling of abandonment bubbles up I'll have enough data to be able to acknowledge that it's something I'm feeling, but that it doesn't reflect reality.
