So I never ended up feeling shitty last night. I don't know if I'm just 80% through this or if I'm squeezing out the last few drops, but I'm no longer in the situations that created this obviously. I'm also neither recreating it with who I choose or by pushing you away. I'm not healed, but part of why I acted that way last night was in anticipation of being less healed than I am. Instead it's just another day and while I feel pretty secure about you, the important thing is that I can trust me apparently. I got me. And on top of that I'm learning that this can be safe actually.
