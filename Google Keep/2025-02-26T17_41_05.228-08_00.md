John cons:
He keeps his screen too dim
He is an anxious driver
He's less emotionally available than I'd prefer
He puts his needs before mine 100% of the time
He likes how I make him feel and how he feels about me, but now enough to do lift a finger about it. He sooooo comfortable alone that he doesn't need me. When it's really a coping mechanism and the fact the I wouldn't put up with his shit while still unhealed is amazing. I love myself.
