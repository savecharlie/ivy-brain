Hey I want you to know I still want to be around you even if we can't do sexy things, ok? Take all the time you need, but I'm here if you need me ok? No pressure. I'm gonna assume Wednesday-X Saturday-âœ“, but I'm open to things. I know things didn't go how either of us expected, but we don't always get to decide what progress looks like. At a minimum I admire the effort you're putting into being emotionally available and I realize that IS kinda what I'm asking for. Sorry being a human sucks and that I'm poking your core childhood wound. No firehose this time. If you want to lose me I'll let you. I hope you don't, but I know I'll survive. You mean alot to me. 

Serious or not, I am looking for something authentic
Just want to be clear, sex and romance can be mutually exclusive for me. Yesterday was romantic for me before we did anything. And Saturday can be romantic without any need for sex
