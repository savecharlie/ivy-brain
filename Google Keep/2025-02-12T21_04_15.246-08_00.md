I'm happy for you. I really wish I could go... Let me know if you hear about something that falls on a weekend?Yeah, there will be one on Feb 22, I think that's a Saturday Well I'm going to that one. I moved out of Portland right before the George Floyd riots started and it's always bugged me I've never gotten to aim fireworks at the cops.Obviously I won't do that unless things go on for weeks lolAnd there are large enough clouds of tear gas to provide anonymity. Seems unlikely in Tucson though 😕Yeah there were zero problems todayJust getting home and cooking dinnerI can't tell if you're being sarcastic lolI'm having cupbopIt's like Korean chipotle I am not being sarcastic. No cops or bad stuff. Some people made bad gestures but nothing like, really bad happenedAnd yeah I had it once on the east side! I liked it!Korean BBQ chicken on riceQuite the synergy we have with our dinners 😉Oh, on Saturday I have us meeting up at 430 to go to moca. I have that right, right?That sounds right. I've been missing you a bitAww 🥰 And wondering how you're feeling about whatever connection we haveOh my friend dyed her hair dark purple today so I can't copy. She has dibsI like our connection! I enjoy talking about stuff. I will admit I haven't started missing you just yet, I do need a little more time apart before that feeling will set in for me.I hope that doesn't sound too blunt, just trying to be up front and honest about where I amI gotta that makes my heart sink actually *Admit thatI shouldn't have askedI knew thatBut yeah I did like imagine you walking up to me at the protest, or at a future protest and just hanging out with peopleThat's missing John What do you think it missing someone is? LolLike, wanting to stop everything else to immediately be with the other person?Not at allHuh. Well, TILFor me it's thinking about someone. Looking forward to being with them at some pointLike I miss my brother, but I'm not flying to Cali tonight and I don't even want toFor me anyway. Maybe that's what some people meanI mean. My state of emotions and self awareness are so shit that it's feasible I'm just wrong 😆 mine does sound a little toxic I guess. Historically when girls give me their virginity I kinda do want to fuck them again and soon, but that's just meI'm being mean. I'm sorry. I'm not in a good placeI'm having feelings for you and it's fucking with my head. I'm probably not ready for datingAnd I switched my therapy to every other week at a bad timeIs your perception of leaving me on read that you're giving me space?I suppose there's a bit of that but also just like. Hm. "I'll write something good later"Write how you actually feel?Like I'm eating and just feeling full and tiredAre you mad?No not at all!I told you I like feeling pursued and you just fucking me and then being whatever about it makes me feel used. I don't need you to confess your undying love, but you won't even give me a bootie call? I don't need to be anyone's one and only, but I do want to feel special. And you did make me feel that way which is why I'm so confused nowI know you have options and that whatever novelty I gave you would wear off, but I didn't think it would be this soon. I thought you felt something, but I guess I was projectingI'll leave you alone. I know you need space for stuff like this. Talk to you later Ok, feeling a bit of a tonal shift here. I do like you and I want to see you again. Maybe I do still overly compartmentalize things of "I'm doing this right now, so I will only think about this". But I am on a very deep level not someone who has ever pursued someone. There may be a variety of reasons playing into why I'm like that, but I do believe in maintaining independence. I am a person with many facets. I enjoy my time with you and I look forward to spending more time with you. I also like talking about what you're working on, what you've done since I've last seen you, how you're handling things, etc. maybe I have a thing where I don't feel safe pursuing people in general. I have never once in my life made a bootie call, for example. This is how I've been feeling. Maybe this is why in person works well for intense convos. You'd have seen my tears lol. And snuggling helps. I'm practically throwing myself at you.. let me? I want my independence too. Thus the poly thing. This is kinda what I was talking about with the behavioral biology stuff. Like for sure monogamy isn't natural, but I'm going to feel shitty if we don't also do some bonding.I'm working on a sculpture for youThat's why I haven't been talking about itFor stupid fucking valentines dayWhich I never doI'm just a stupid girl. I'm sorryDon't apologize for having and feeling your emotions.Ok I'm sorry for having feelings for you. You aren't looking for serious even if it's poly and I should take my clingy ass elsewhereI hope this isn't too much in context with everything else, but I do feel like I should let you know that I do have plans on Valentine's Day. Maybe I should have done nothing on Valentine's Day to better hold true to no one relationship meaning more to me than any other, that's something I need to explore with. But I want to set that expectation. This is not me trying to do a power play or anything like that.I guess do you feel like I'm incapable of being with you the way you need a partner to be?At least right nowI don't know because I'm not fully clear on what you want and feel. I don't want to say goodbye to you, but if you feel like I'm not respecting you, you deserve to feel better than that. You deserve to feel respected. I do respect you, but if you don't feel it, I don't want you to compromise yourself.What is your perception of this conversation?I think confused.I feel like we really hit it off, my conversations with you in text before were great, in person were great, but then for like 48 hours after we have sex things are just frayed even though we talk about how safe and comfortable we feel in each other's arms I'm trying to figure out if the spark that I'm feeling is something that only I'm feeling or not. I'm trying to ask if you're open to something serious. Like to me commitment isn't promises or titles. It's action in the moment that shows your dedication and you've been doing that. I'm trying to figure out if this has any room to go somewhere before I break my own heart more.I don't think things are frayed so much as I'm falling apart in general I like how things are. I'm just scaredI like how things are. Commitment in general scares me, so maybe I freeze around it.I have not been able to commit to things in the past. My therapist is adamant I should not commit to anything serious or long term because I'm not emotionally ready to do that and I'm not in a place to fully comprehend what commitment means.I don't need you to call me your girlfriend or anythingI just want to acknowledge you treat me like one already And if you want to do that I need to do a feeling check-in now and again to make sure I'm not delusionalI suppose I don't even know what that means in the context of ENM. You are my friend. You are a girl. We go on dates. We hug, we kiss, we fuck. I like to talk to you. I like to feel safe in your arms. I like to feel you wrapped up in my arms.I actually was thinking about how do I introduce you to my friends. "Good friend"? "Girlfriend"?I just call you John lolYou can call me whatever is simplest for that convo. I don't careLol ok that's fair 😆Maybe you're better at compartmentalizing than I am. My feelings for you don't stop when I leave your apartment or even when I'm on a date with someone.Well when I'm on a date with women because you've made all the men I'm talking to boring so thanks for that lolOh no 😮And I guess I am. I had to learn how to compartmentalize. I had to isolate what was happening at home or else it would have been totally overwhelming.That makes sense. And helps make sense of how confusing you are. Can we keep giving it a shot for a bit even though we're a little crazy?Going for a star walk with my momI would like that very much 😊Aww, enjoy that!Well that was nice.. but chilly. I got all my painting stuff here now. It's so pretty out here I want to start doing landscapes again since I don't have to go anywhere for a viewTalking to you helped. I'm processing so much anxious attachment bullshit so thanks. And seeing you has really been a catalyst helping me continue healing that.Hmmm, there are some very nice views there 😉I might come across as more crazy than I actually am while processing old feelings I'm glad. I do like talking to you. Even if I have to examine my icky emotions 😉I get that Part of me thinks it would be hot to sneak you into my room like a teenagerBut realistically I will not be able to be quiet lolShe's so folded up and comfyNo brain just cozyShe's now watching the TV with me See I really do think she has at least 4 brain cells actually Oh I never told you I'm taking a break from weed which is contributing to my mental state for sure. I have a medical need for it so it's a hard balance to strike, but I didn't like that I kept feeling like I needed it. For instance, "sure kissing this guy is nice, but wouldn't it be even nicer if I was higher?" is the kind of thought I don't want to have.  Ah yeah, I can totally understand how destabilizing that can be. I hope it gets easier with time ❤️Of the things I've changed in the last year this is pretty easy. And so is talking to you. I think my inner child has some reasonable fears, but I don't have to let her drive. I'll try to be more direct in the future. For instance, I'm looking for people who make me feel valued and special and not just on days they see me. I hope you're one of those people because you really get me goingI do value you all the time. But I may just not express myself well.You do deserve to feel valued.I can be ok with that for now. We'll find something that works for us I thinkMhmm. I am going to go shower off and head to bed. I am a little stinky from being in the sun all day 😆Same. Goodnight ❤️😘Good morning! My ex arranged childcare today so I get to work on my art and see friends on a weekday yay!Yay! I'm just waking up 😆 I guess protesting knocked it out of me a bit hahaMade some progress on your thing. It's just a practice piece so it's quite likely to be a bit junky. It is however a functional thing since you said that's something you valueSo this a welding technique for making round corners, but I didn't know it existed before I came up with it on my ownOhhhh. looking fancy 🥰Hey uh can I refer to you as my boyfriend in contexts where men won't take my no for an answer but back off if I'm already getting fucked by someone? Yeah, of course!Ok cause boys suck and they're worse online. I do wish I could have sex with strangers because I need it bad 😈hehe. well right now i'm like mentally preparing for my weekly annoying meetingbut why don't you be a good girl and get your big buttplug vibrator out? work yourself up to that. imagine my hard cock lubed up and penetrating your ass. vibrating with anticipation before my load erupts deep in your sexy ass 😉You got this! 😉 If you need to decompress after I'm hereOh fuck! Yes Daddy! 😍well that wasn't entirely terriblehow was your afternoon? 😉I'm glad! It was disappointing... It was really sweet and hot for you to do that but I was unexpectedly interrupted right as I was going to ask permission to cum 😭Oh no 😯 I'm sorry. Maybe another time will just work out better?Taking a break to fold some laundryI'm also doing laundry!Appropriate Watching random Nova episodes and this came up. Connie is learning about having bird brain 😆No offense Connie She does like watching nature programs especially Honestly I just need fucked. I keep getting offers from guys that take things sexual too quickly. Eh, I am probably putting out that vibe though so I get it. I can wait if I must 😜The girl I'm seeing wants me bad, but we're taking things slow 🦥It is hot that she's honoring that agreement with herselfIt isWell I guess I'll just keep working until I can sleep again and I won't have time to be hornyAs hard as I may be thinking about what a good girl you've been, I do need to tidy up to have some friends over later this evening for our weekly hang out. I understand. I'm feeling very small today. I need to meditate to get back into that goddess energy I like to be in. Ttyl 👋🏻Well I got my Thursdays wrong, but I got all prettied up anywayMakeup is hard lolAwww 😉Well, the effect is always stunning 😍DawYou're both dorksIt's cuteFriends headed home. It was my first time actually seeing my friends boyfriend, Zach, perform so that was pretty coolOh what kind of performance?He plays flute for TSO. He was part of a TSO quartet playing at the Tucson museum of art first Thursday event and then we all got dinnerOh I almost went to that I like when there's live music there for those Mmhmm. It was very niceWell I feel much better now that I've done all the self care and meditating I was neglecting. Thanks for being patient with my crazy. I'm working through itI think the abandonment wound got triggered and I'm not abandoning me so it's all good actuallyI'm glad you were able to recharge that. It's important to not neglect the self. Someone told me it's good to be selfish, you're the only person who knows what you need.For the time being that's seeing you Saturday and being open to whatever this is. Or isn't And a bunch of other stuff in my life obviously I need to stop being so particular about how the things I want appear in my lifeAnd maybe you're just here to point me in the right direction or whatever. Who knows Yeah. And I need to not live in a fantasy world and stay in the real world. We both need to meet each other where we sremAreWhat do you mean?I think you should be allowed a few fantasies 😜It's easy for me to be like "I think everything is going great in my head", but I may be choosing to ignore subconciously things that are said Ah not quite that type of fantasy 😆What was said? I'm lost honestly I think things are going great. I just got in my head...Oh nothing specific. Just in general I guess I may like. Oh they sreI think so. I'm just being open about the types of mistakes I have a tendency to makeI think an example might help me?I'm not being obtuse I swearI am drawing a blank right now 😆No I understand All good ya goof😘I wishHey do you have any stuffed animals?Kind of. I have two stuffed otters that are sitting in the top of my cabinetsWhen I grew up, I had a bunch My two favorites were Winnie the Pooh and shamuAweMeow?Is a kitty hungry for some milk? 😉The fucking wave of electricity that goes through my body when even type that stuff is wild honestly When youHeheI'm not used to like, talking like that. But it is fun 😊I certainly like it. I have fake freckles lolAw those are cute 🥰 also digging the smirk 😏Experimenting with different make up things tonight?Well as long as I'm in for the night it can't hurt. I wouldn't go out like thisI think you'd look great out on the town with any of those looks ❤️ although the cat ears may depend on the precise scene 😆I have a tail to match 😽I didn't really ever consider anything like pet play, but I could see that being a moodI have never used it because no one's tamed me yetSo it's not a kink I have so much as a thing in my drawerBut thinking about you pulling my tail does do something for me apparently Well, I have heard of tail butt plugs 😉Oh that's this Ohh la la
