You were supposed to be selfish because you were the one hurting.

Yesterday there was a moment when you said I don't love you and it really hurt, but I think in that moment, or at least the ones preceding it, you were right. I felt love for you, but I wasn't doing love. I couldn't, but it doesnt matter why. I don't want to hurt you. Considering I was unconsciously poking your core wound as hard as I could to trigger you into hurting or abandoning me, you actually showed you are a very safe person. That wasn't my conscious intention or even my unconscious intention, but I think it was helpful for me to see actually.
 
I'm just afraid I've broken our connection. I both smothered it and hurt it. I was just seeking the feeling of safety. I didn't mean to, but I set you up for failure.

I'm sorry.

That said, I have been triggered by your selfishness and sometimes it's been appropriate. I don't think it's asking too much or rejecting you (anymore than your desire for me to figure out how to self regulate so I can be kind when I communicate my needs) to meet me in the middle or at least have a discussion when our needs are in conflict. Even if I end up agreeing with you that, ya ivy should just go home and that sucks and we'll figure it out another day, I still want to be part of the process of deciding that.

I thought of one thing we can try. You probably won't relish the idea, but I'd like to try going over the hurtful things I've said while dissociated so I can try to explain. I.e. "I want you to make me want to see you" doesn't mean I don't want to see you. It means I don't feel very courted. I feel taken for granted and even though I'm yours, I feel hurt, but I don't know how to express that correctly. I feel like I won't get what I need so why bother. I feel like I'm abandoning myself by continuing to give while I don't feel safe.

I think we're making progress and I think I sabotaged things harder *because* we were doing well. When I ask what my heart wants in this situation, it's you. I want to be good to you even when I don't understand what's happening yet. I want you John; for a number of reasons, but make no mistake I want you. 

Today's card is judgement 🙀⚖️📯 and the Ivy is medicated! 💊⚡💡🧠🤯🐆💨

Questions:

1. When I asked about that picture you said it made you really mad. Why?
2. What makes you feel safe after a fight?

Things to try: 

1. Going over things I say that are hurtful while dissociated so I can try to explain. I.e. "I want you to make me want to see you" doesn't mean I don't want to see you. It means I don't feel very courted. I feel taken for granted and even though I'm yours, I feel hurt, but I don't know how to express that correctly. I feel like I won't get what I need so why ask
2. 

You are enough for me. The issue is that you should be enough to make me feel safe, but my parents made that difficult for me.
