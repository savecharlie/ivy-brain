Morning my dear, how are you? 

Remember what it was. I vetoed something on YouTube, but I think you were just trying to do some morning routine relaxation stuff after asking to do parallel play. I found it distracting and had forgotten about the parallel play at that moment so I didn't put things together. 

I'll remember. It's a small thing. Just trying to be proactive.

What are we doing tomorrow? Playing with the telescope?
