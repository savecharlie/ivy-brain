I've been thinking about your description of "missing" someone and to me it sounds an awful lot like codependency so I'm glad you don't feel that way.

The person who is always pulling away in a relationship has all the power. 

Just like you are afraid of commitment I'm afraid of abandonment and we need to find a balance.

It would make me feel safe if we had check-ins about our feelings towards each others and maybe we could have a regular date night at some point?
