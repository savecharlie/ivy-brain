If I'd waited last night would we still be trying? I really liked every moment of last night until we went in the bedroom. I want that back. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to give me something, anything....

Why can't we do what's best for us instead?

To be clear you're going to keep pursuing other relationships, but just want with me because I wanted to be close to you?

I'm keeping my tickets for that date with you because I'm not giving up on you. 

I'm trying to think of reasons you'd do all this besides A) you have feelings for me and it's scaring you (please go learn about avoidant attachment)

B) you wanted to hurt me more

I love you John. I'm not a love addict. You're the fourth person I've ever fallen for in my whole life. Please fight for us.
