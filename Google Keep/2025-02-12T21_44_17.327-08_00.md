I wish I understood your perspective better. I think I conceive of some of the process, but I don't really relate. From my perspective I'm in trouble for having needs too. And I get why you'd need time to process certain things, but why can't you acknowledge my feelings at least? Or address the more serious stuff? Or any of it? I tell you I feel used and you'll get back to me in 5-10 business days?! You might not think I'm right to feel this way, but the customer is right dude. Everytime we spend time together and I try to get closer to you after, you push me away and it makes me feel like a chewed up piece of gum. You keep saying I'm allowed to be selfish, but I don't think that's true when it comes into conflict with what you want. I don't think I was asking for very much. I just wanted you to show me how felt. You led me to believe you were working on communication. This is hurting me. I'm a real person. If I knew this is how you'd react I'd have kept my mouth shut long enough for you to at least like me back first. I would have done what these smart women (who have been dating men half their life) do and kept my promise to myself not to come up to your apartment. I should have taken it slow. Now it's probably unsalvageable. Like what could you even say? You'll submit to a schedule and resent me for it? If you wanted me, you'd come get me. I feel so dumb. How did you stop believing in love? I wish I could.
