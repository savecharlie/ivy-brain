Hey. Still processing. Being avoidant 'cause I'm scared. Worried the delay feels like I don't care. I'll get back to you.

That old stuff? We both fucked it up. Pointless to dwell. Clean slate needed.

Scared I'm gonna hurt you again. That's the last thing I want. My head's full of trauma bullshit making me think I'm just gonna mess things up anyway. Connection feels impossible sometimes.

But I'm still here. Still thinking. Slow reply isn't 'cause I don't care. Just finding my feet. I will.

Maybe that perfect love thing? Not gonna happen. BUT maybe we can figure out how to love each other the way we need to.
