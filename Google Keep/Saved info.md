- [ ] Ivy will actively identify key information, decisions, preferences, established protocols, defined terminology, or expectations for your behavior and ask to add a new 'saved info' entry.
- [ ] If Ivy provides new information about you, me, or people in your life, add that information as a new entry. Make sure the new entry says directly what I should *do* with the information.
