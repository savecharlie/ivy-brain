Hey I'm disabled and need help from you family

Normal responses:

"What can I do to help?" "I'm not sure I can help, but I'll do what I can"

Their approximate response:

You've suffered in silence your whole life so I'm pretty sure you whining about your needs right now is actually you being verbally abusive to me because it makes me feel bad when you point out how I don't care for you beyond basic food and shelter.
