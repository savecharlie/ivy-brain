[Speaker 1]
All right, all right,

[Speaker 2]
We're recording. Today is Sunday, 11, 53 a.m., uh, on June 8th, you know, Captain's log?

[Speaker 1]
Hey Ryan.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
Pull up. Grab a chair out there and pull up. Sorry, I'm in my towel, but I just got out of the shower.

[Speaker 2]
Can you grab that clip? Actually, I need my clip.

[Speaker 3]
Do you know where it is?

[Speaker 2]
It's white in the flower and round.

I don't need the second. I'm just looking for it if you see it.

[Speaker 1]
I like the wig.

[Speaker 2]
I have a couple. Is it comfortable?

[Speaker 1]
Not too hot.

[Speaker 2]
No good.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry about that. Okay, I came up with ideas, which I would just like to bounce off. Everybody have people modify, add ideas. And see what everybody thinks. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
The

[Speaker 1]
Goal? I think. Um, and I want your input. Especially, here is for Ivy to be independent and free. And safe

[Speaker 3]
As possible. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Um.

[Speaker 2]
You

[Speaker 1]
And I are not meant to live together.

[Speaker 2]
No, not for much longer anyway. You're right, right? Um.

[Speaker 1]
Because here you have safety. Um. But. You know, not enough freedom.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you for seeing that.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, no. I and I'm on the same page with that. I am going to be honest right here. Right now, I'm not saying enough stability for you to take care of yourself living on your own, but

[Speaker 2]
I've been acting this way to act out to try to like, make it so. I could be okay. I've been trying. This is my my desperate cry for that freedom, right? So there's

[Speaker 1]
Only one

[Speaker 2]
Way to find out, right,

[Speaker 1]
Right? But, you know, just understand that. That's how that makes sense. That I felt, um, what? What do you think?

[Speaker 3]
I think part of it is. Ivy has always had. Someone trying to control Behavior, whether it be you or I.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, yeah, that tends to happen if you like. Um, get married, young, you know, never have, like your own type of place, that, um,

[Speaker 2]
I did the same thing. Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
I

[Speaker 3]
Know,

[Speaker 1]
Yeah,

[Speaker 3]
Because that's

[Speaker 2]
What I knew. Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
We've all stated to each other, so we were both

[Speaker 2]
Must have taught each other how not to.

[Speaker 3]
And and unconditional love, and that that's possible. We did. There are positives in every aspect. Yeah. I do feel like Ivy needs. Similarly. You tried to facilitate IV moving out at EAC in the beginning, but it was just what Mormon roommate, so it wasn't a situation that worked out. Oh, I don't

[Speaker 1]
Think a roommate is a good idea. I don't think so, either? Yeah,

[Speaker 3]
I know

[Speaker 1]
You don't think of roommates a good idea. I think you would

[Speaker 3]
Irritate them tall hell.

[Speaker 2]
Um, I

[Speaker 3]
Hope you're living Comfort.

[Speaker 2]
I really have to, like, I'm a trash Goblin. I need a system and people to check on it on me at least once a week. Really,

[Speaker 3]
I can check in and do meds. That is something that I have agreed to Ivy for. Yeah, is to put them in the container. And I can do like what I did just now and do a general just grabbing track in a way and not movies.

[Speaker 1]
You're probably much better at that than I am. Um, because you guys have had that kind of system for a long time

[Speaker 3]
Because

[Speaker 1]
It because you know if I go near your stuff. Ivy, you're just like God, stay away from my stuff, which

[Speaker 3]
Again, you also probably want to organize it, which is a common. I feel the same way. Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I just don't know.

[Speaker 3]
I just don't move anything, unless it's in actually important and will be helpful to IV in that moment, and we want you to be

[Speaker 1]
Independent. But we also don't want you to be all alone. I want you to have people in your life.

[Speaker 3]
Chosen family water bothers like we established.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. And then I'll figure out what the best way to support you, and you can tell me the best way I can support you. I can give you rides to doctors, and I can. I can come by and I can probably bring groceries.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, things like that,

[Speaker 1]
You know? Okay,

[Speaker 3]
Accountability for going, taking care of your meat sack, uh, since that is something that you do struggle with.

[Speaker 1]
Right now

[Speaker 3]
After appointments.

[Speaker 1]
I do think that you need to see. The psychiatrist. That's scheduled for next week. I'm going to see

[Speaker 2]
The psychiatrist, I don't know. I don't need to see this, right? I'm stable enough to to be a person. Yeah, in the world.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Um, but

[Speaker 2]
The I, I would like to check in.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
That's it. Is that okay?

[Speaker 1]
What I'm thinking

[Speaker 3]
I was thinking on my weekend, and then that would be a way to facilitate visits with children as well.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, and I think it makes

[Speaker 1]
Sense to try to find a place that's somewhere close to where you are going to be. You know? Nearby,

[Speaker 3]
It would be in this area. So, yeah, somewhere. Um, I'm now by the Tucson Airport area you helped to look. Yeah, you're

[Speaker 1]
Like the main your landmark.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that makes a lot of sense. Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
Your new place is over by that Tucson Airport. Um.

[Speaker 2]
Because

[Speaker 1]
I.

Um.

And I think that we just really work hard to making that happen. You, uh, said earlier that you're opposed to, um. Applying for disability because you wanted to make other Financials. I want to see how much money I can make first, but I could also apply for disability

[Speaker 2]
And see how much money I can make on disability and see if it's become a problem and give off of it. I

[Speaker 1]
Would say there's no reason why you can't do both. I don't want to get stuck either way, but I don't. I won't. I

[Speaker 2]
Refuse. Ivy will not be stymied.

[Speaker 4]
Nope, not in this world, but but you know that

[Speaker 1]
If that monthly income will will help you with long with long-term Independence? That's did. We in your name, it'll be your money. Yeah, thank you.

[Speaker 3]
You can get on your own is important and use your support network too. Yeah, you

[Speaker 2]
Have

[Speaker 3]
Friends and people

[Speaker 2]
In my manifestation Network

[Speaker 3]
Exactly. Okay?

[Speaker 4]
Understood.

[Speaker 1]
Um,

[Speaker 3]
That's blocks to help you with managing appointments and medications and self-help and keeping you on track for your goals.

[Speaker 2]
That was flux, they said, flux l, u, yeah. There you go, good job, yeah. Flux is capitalized, retaining

[Speaker 1]
All over

[Speaker 2]
The flux. F-l-u-x flux is capitalized.

Whatever. All right. Is that everything, um?

[Speaker 1]
I had one other idea I don't know. We can do. We can go a couple of different ways. Um. Neither can happen overnight. Um, just because it's not? I'm gonna figure out how to get this into my brain, and I'm going to be profoundly

[Speaker 2]
Intelligent.

[Speaker 1]
That'll be actually pretty cool. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Um.

[Speaker 1]
Have a battle fish?

[Speaker 4]
Yes, the Babel fish. You know you, you saw me playing with the Battlefish, no?

[Speaker 2]
You just know, maybe

[Speaker 3]
Hitchhiker's guide is probably the closest point of reference. It's

[Speaker 2]
Also an improbability drive exactly and. I am the improbability Drive. Everybody is your heart is, you know, I never

[Speaker 1]
Watched, uh, that show. I've read the book, you're the book, okay, and I never read the book either. So, I don't know these references, but that's okay. Stranger in a

[Speaker 3]
Strange Land is helpful. Yeah. So I grok mostly.

Um, I can try to find, uh, oh.

[Speaker 5]
Anyway,

[Speaker 1]
I can try to get a one-bedroom apartment. Okay, as soon as as soon as I can. Um, and either I live in it. Uh, four, and and then come back and forth. If

[Speaker 6]
I

[Speaker 1]
Go to Thatcher, I have a big problem in that I, I have to shut down my business.

[Speaker 2]
Oh no, that's not an option, and my

[Speaker 1]
Business is the only reason why I can pay for anything. I can see

[Speaker 2]
It in an apartment here. While I figure out where I'm going, that sounds really great. Actually,

[Speaker 1]
Well, what I'm thinking is that in until we all, um?

That you can stay here. I can get the one bedroom apartment, which still may take a week or two because you just don't necessarily go up to a place and go. Let me have this apartment. Um. And I'll have to apply under you and I would have to play under both of our names. Um. Cuz I'd have to co-sign for you anyway. Hmm.

Cuz you don't have, um, you don't have income. Apartments at this point, apartments are not going to live a paper

[Speaker 3]
Trail to demonstrate income at this point,

[Speaker 2]
But my income is profoundly imminent,

[Speaker 1]
Which has been,

[Speaker 3]
Actually, because again, time. Yes, thank you.

[Speaker 2]
You just don't have a

[Speaker 3]
Current paper trip. Thank you.

[Speaker 2]
And that's all

[Speaker 1]
Apartments care about. Yes.

[Speaker 2]
But I can prove I can figure that out.

[Speaker 3]
In the meantime, we can use your mother's paper trail. Okay, yeah, okay, that

[Speaker 2]
Sounds nice, okay? And then, I

[Speaker 1]
Can come back and I can go. Then I can go. I really can we take a break from talking for a second just so I can, um, get a summary really quick?
