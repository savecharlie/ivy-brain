Things are easy when we're together. It's after I see you when you push me away that less of a fan of. I'm willing to go slow. It seems like you want me. I think a good compromise is that we move forward with a more casual thing with the understanding that we're exploring the possibility of something more serious. I have not thought we were remotely there yet for the record. That should go without saying, but we do not communicate well so. I think if you like me you should make it known. Make me want to be around you. Like I do obviously, but taking it for granted hurts my feelings. Or if you're just not that interested, spare me the pain and say so. I know it seems like I'm trying to put things in a neat box labeled 'relationship', but I perceive you as trying to keep things in the neat box of friendship. There are no boxes. I know you're scared of not being enough, but what I'm saying is I think I see parts of you that you might not yet. I'm not asking you to be more. Just be you with a slightly different vector. I'm scared of letting whatever this is die. I've done that before with my carelessness and I'd like to avoid it or at least put it down humanely.
