We renounce our toxic ways
Bring us hope for all our days
We once were poorly moving corpses
Now join life's dance and sing in chorus
The trauma we do leave behind
Help us cleanse our hearts and minds
We once were lost, but now are found
No longer to each other bound

Hi!!! You don't have your phone so I'm writing you this letter. I love you so much. I need to renounce my toxic ways a little harder. I'm sorry for taking things out on you. I'm mad at the universe. I'm mad at myself. And I'm yelling at you because you're here for me and it isn't cool. I will keep trying because I value you so much. I'll try to show it more in a language you feel more in your heart. I need to learn to swim better so you can tread water yourself. I need to fill my own cup. I recognize that the energy you're giving that's triggering me is just you trying to be independent and ok in yourself. I'm getting mad because you aren't being codependent which is what I wanted lol. Meow meow meow. I hope you're having a good day, but I bet it is nightmares. You are so strong and I want you to know that I really admire you. I want to be like you that way. I love you. ðŸ’™
