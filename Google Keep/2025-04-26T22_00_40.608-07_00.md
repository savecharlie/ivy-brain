Hey I want to say I'm really sorry. I've been learning more about my trauma response and even after implementing what I learned I find I can be confusing and hurtful to my partners. I go into a varying levels of dissociation when I don't feel safe. I was blind. Not an excuse. No pressure to reconnect or anything. I was just thinking about you and how I hurt you.
