Would you like me to play with your tail? 😏MmmhmmWhy must sleep be important to you?Or at all actually. Somebody needs to get on thatIt is interesting how many processes happen when you sleepI get frisky at night pretty consistentlyEven in my sleep 👀Deep in my porn addiction I would isolate in my home office at night while she was going to bed early and look at pornOr go on only fans or look at escort listingsWell maybe that's a need you have. It's ok to have needsA shame we're not neighborsIt was an unhealthy coping strategy. It was a lie I told myself. I need porn to jack off to sleep.But I could sleep by simply reading a book before bedOh speaking of getting to see people I get to meet my friend Alis in person!You could fuck a person?That seems healthy to meYeah. Well. It depends.It's the justification ?If I am having sex because I'm sharing an intimate moment, that is healthyI feel like that's what I've experienced so farIt's been really healthy and healing for meIf I am using them to get myself off and it literally could be any person, I just need the orgasm, then it's not healthyThank youYeah. There's only one time since moving out on my own I've had what might be construed as unhealthy sex There was maybe a point when you were fucking me that you looked like you were enjoying it for less wholesome reasons, but I approve because overall it was part of something healthy and also it was hotPart of my unhealthy thinking is imagining that you're stringing me along. I wish I didn't do thatBut honestly no one really ever shows up for me the way I do for them so it's fair my inner child thinks itBut we're trying something new and trusting John and the universe A little curious about that. And yeah once things start, lust and stuff are real 😆 but I am not stringing you along. If I do feel like it's time to end things, I will talk about it with you. That's a sad thought, but that's not how I'm feeling now.And also going back a tiny bit, sleep hygiene is important to me because when I isolate at night, it becomes easier for me to do bad thingsWho said anything about being alone?It doesn't have to be an all the time thing, but it's on the tableWhen it alignsWell, tonight I'm feeling uncomfortably full from eating wayyy too much. So yeah no jiggling around for me tonight for sure 😆Ok. I did say I'd do more of the work next time though so hold me to it whenever that isI looked up anal positions and saw some fun ones on topAlso I got a cleaner thing and lube shooters. Because that's my new favorite thingLol! Sounds like a fun way to spend a Saturday night 😉Connie's wilding on the pillowsOh that's just a really good picture of herShe makes me feel super calmAlso I should really listen to Chappelle roanI'm not able to capture the chaotic bursts of energy between these photosShe's got some good songs to cry about a situationship to while being deeply irrational Connie...Yeah I've seen a lot of friends talking about herLook how wide Connie's eye is if you zoom in on the last ineI'm headed to bed. Talk to you tomorrowGood night 😘I just want to kiss you! I'm sorry I'm being a teenager, but I'm having fun!Goodnight blarghGood morning! Woke up with quite the case of morning wood 😉 saving that energy for tomorrow night ❤️Mmm. Haha same. It's hot🥵Oh yeah you haven't seen thatHeheheI hope you have a good day! Got anything going on?Just work and then a first date tonightWell maybe you won't need to wait lolHello Conniethat's where she likes to hide while i work lolI got 50 errands to doBut I'm gonna get my charcoal out laterand yeah i suppose it could go that way, but i anticipate things going a little bit slower, and i'm good with thatohhhhWhat?with the dateOh I meant the oh part lolI found some really fancy charcoal paper I never used for some reasonoh, just remarking on .. well presume the charcoal is to make charcoal art and not doing a bbq?charcoal looks cool. but i absolutely hate working with it. i don't like the way it feels in my hands.No but that sounds good too. People smoke watermelon apparently and I want to try jtI'm a dirty girl!oh that does sound interestingheheheheyou are 😉I'll be clean for you on Saturday though... At the start anyway Well I gotta go goinghave a good day!You too 😘Got some of the art I've collected put up. My mom got me this:Ohhhh that looks really cool!I like natural art with crazy geometry It really spoke to me. It reminds me of some of my psychedelic experiencesVery cool 😎How was your day? You gotta get ready for that date! 🌹heh yeah, was just getting out of the shower and getting dressed. just taking connie on a quick walk. it was mostly ok. just work stuff. at one point sanford wanted to meet with everyone to talk about redesigning our public facing website. he's making it more complicated then it needs to be and keeps repeating questions until he gets the answer he wants to hear. and then he was like "so john, what are you working on?" love when he's just totally aloof about what we're trying to do. it's not like i have mentioned it every thursday, but he just... doesn't listen to other people. if a meeting goes too long without him getting to talk, he'll start clowning around. it's kind of embarrassingI'm really sorry. Planning on his antics on Thursday is enough without him springing this shitYou deserve a better for sure. Weird hypothetical, but what would you do if he was never going to retire and would live forever?Get serious about quitting and finding some other WFH engineering job Does doing that align with you? Like when you get quiet and listen to your heart without being influenced by fears?Big question...I'm not sureYeah one that'll take time and going inside and shitHey I hope you have a good date! ❤️Aw thank you! I hope you have a good night!It is certain For example:Cloud volcano Ohhh that's so cool!And yeah, date went well. Fun conversation and dinner.That's great!I'm being lazy nowIn a big ol beanbagDo you want to play a game tomorrow maybe?Yay beanbags, that sounds comfySure! Do you have something in mind?I was looking through what I got here and I have pass the pigs and poetry for neanderthals. Not much to pick fromI liked pass the pigs when I was a kid. It's just luck thoughI wish I had splendor hereNobody will play splendor with me because I always win but you're smarter than me so So I do have a bunch of 2 player games here. We can look through them 😊 I also have a few bedroom games I bought that I've never played 🥵Oh like what?I won't do like sex dice.

But they look the same so just one photoWhat spoke to you the most?The blacklight one I didn't even second guessThe chakra ones I saw across the shop and just bought two because he didn't have a bigger oneThe bowl I saw yesterday walking around killing time before dinner 😆 and I had him put it aside for me to buy todayI'm glad you got to have so much fun ☺️I didn't know it was a bowl!What is the blacklight one?I forgot 😆 but they gave me a labelSix minutes awayThank you for my cum 😋Goodnight!Hehehe. Just got home. Good night!Good morning! How are you feeling today?Still spasming. There's a non zero chance I somehow managed to gluten myself which can trigger this level and length of spasmsI had fun yesterday though :)Oh no bad gluten :( but yes 😊I don't regret keeping you up, but I don't want to make a habit of itHey I think I trust you enough to tie me up if that's something you're interested inUhhh yeah that might be 😆 do I need to get a pair of handcuffs? Ones that you could open? I'm down to like build up in gradual steps. Something I bought recently is a under the bed tie down system 😆This is SomaThat seems like a good starting spot. Eventually I want to be spider gagged lolAwe hello... Soma looks maybe part ragdoll She showed up in Matt's vents one fayDayAh yes, the cat distribution system. My cat has started sitting on me the whole time I'm at the apartment.Good kitty I can be a good kitty lolMmmhmmmm 🥵🥵🥵How'd your day go?Not too bad! Overall feeling tired but played games with my buddies and got dinner. Watching TV and doing some chores now.That's nice. I had a lazy day. By necessity. Getting much more stoned than I'd prefer is what it takes to be pain free when that's happening. Went on a hike with my mom. And did some portraiture practice. And chatted with my friend Alis. She just got kicked out of her bowling league for being trans. And my cousin can't get her hormones. Scary shit.Oh no 😮 I'm sorry... Is your cousin also in Arizona?Yeah in Phoenix A doctor agreed to see her pro bono tomorrowWhich is cool, but scary that's happening Yeahhhhh My innocent little heart almost can't handle how evil the world can be. I know this is our path, but fuckI want trail mix so bad right now Hehe, trail mix is good. Going to have to find a new source tho 😢Oh no! They stopped selling your favorite?You should mix your own!No, but I don't exactly want to shop there since the inauguration Someone needs to make me a list so I know where to shopOr make an appYeah...There is a part of me that sees the appeal of homesteading and not having to rely on anyone
