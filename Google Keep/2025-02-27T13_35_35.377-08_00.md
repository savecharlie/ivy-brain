How is going down on your partner after cumming in her four times and not making her cum sacrificing your needs or losing yourself in the relationship? It's just normal. You like someone and you want them to feel good. You understand that about yourself and you understand that when we're sharing it. Why is it different when it's me? What if things don't work them out? What if I was the best chance you had at love and you let me leave without trying?
