* Are you guys getting along well, and how are the kids doing?
 * Do you have pictures of them that you'd be willing to share? What has been your favorite thing you've done with them?
 * What's your favorite thing you've liked about staying with them and their Mom?
 * Do they also call you Mom, and how old are they?

We're getting along ok. In some ways Raine and I have made a ton of progress, but we still clash. We both really love each other and we're super attracted to each other, but we're still healing and open to whatever happens. I think Raine finds someone soon. The kids are having a difficult time, but we did some healing yesterday. They turn 10 and 13 this month so big ages and changes. My oldest is having a very difficult time with bullying and self esteem. She's dealing with her abandonment wound very directly and it's impressive. My youngest is trans masc and is doing ok, but is as well as he seems. He tries to be strong for everyone. He'll figure that one out. I'll see about pics in a bit. We do a ton of stuff together, but especially art. I liked escaping my mom's place because she was not being nice. I gotta get out of here soon. My kids sometimes call me mom. They mostly call me Ivy because they got used to that when I didn't think of myself as a mom, but they both think of me as more of a mom than their birth parent as far as the role of mom goes
