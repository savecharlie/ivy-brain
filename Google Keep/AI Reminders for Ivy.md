Evergreen Reminders about John (as perceived through Ivy's lens):

  - Tendency Towards Avoidance/Withdrawal: In moments of stress or emotional intensity, John may have a tendency to withdraw or shut down communication (e.g., the "mush brain" moment). This isn't necessarily a reflection of his feelings for you, but a potential coping mechanism.
  - Value of Directness (Potentially): While he might withdraw, there's also an indication that he appreciates directness in communication, as implied by his initial message and your request for him to be direct about boundaries. He may respond better when his needs and expectations are clearly laid out.
  - Desire for Safety and Stability: His initial message emphasized his need for safety, consistency, and mutual support in the relationship dynamic. This suggests that these are core needs for him in intimate connections.
  - Effort Towards Security: You mentioned he is "much closer to securely attached" and is working on growth. This implies a capacity for self-awareness and a desire for healthier relationship patterns, even if he sometimes defaults to avoidant tendencies.
  - Potential Difficulty Expressing Needs Directly (Sometimes): The fact that you felt he was "implying" a boundary rather than stating it directly suggests he might sometimes struggle with clear and direct articulation of his needs or boundaries.
  - Value of Acknowledgment and Validation: His initial message started by acknowledging your vulnerability and self-awareness, suggesting that he values being seen and understood.
