I can't promise that what happened last time won't happen again. I feel like you need me to be healed already. Maybe I feel that way about myself. There's no such thing as being fully healed. Not only do I want you, but 

I don't like the pressure of feeling like you're going to break up with me unless I act the way you want.
I didn't listen very well. I will try to slow down on messeges. 

I don't want to disappoint you anymore. We can see how things go on Wednesday. I hope I behave well enough to keep deserving to see you.

I really love that you call me on my shit

I punished you for telling me what you needed and I am so sorry love.
