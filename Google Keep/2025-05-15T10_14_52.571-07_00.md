So when it comes to certain things going forward, when it comes to making decisions if we wait until we have ALL the info it will be too late to act.. the opportunity will be gone. It's better to make a decision, risk a mistake, and fix it if we need to. Mitigating risk is wise, but so is action while anticipating a pivot. That could for instance look like shorter leases. For me now and us later as an example.
