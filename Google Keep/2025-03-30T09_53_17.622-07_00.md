You were asking me about signs and it's hard to remember all of them because they keep coming at me all day. A cool one from this morning was the tip of a lynx's ear falling onto the words "calm your mind". And I noticed my earbud in a bag of funyuns and when I pulled it out a small ring followed it. Both right ears. The first one is self explanatory and the second is a call back to yesterday when I found a circle on me. I told you I get impressions on my skin from jewelry and other things as signs. Yesterday I found a circle on me and the impression that I got from that and surrounding signs that I was seeing while driving was that I'm chosen which is sweet. I love you too Universe! Another from this morning you might find interesting and I haven't fully interpreted is I accidentally scryed on some reflective plastic. I saw a stairway to heaven, but it was on it's side. Like it's already here, but you have to look at it right. What do you make of that one?
