There can be times when you need longer for sure and I don't need grand gestures. I need consistent effort and clear communication. And I like to move faster in the beginning to find out if it's worth my time faster. A question: can you have a romantic friendship? Because that's what this feels like to me. Not prioritizing one relationship over isn't necessarily about time. It's about need. If you're taking on so many partners as to spread yourself so thin you can't meet any of our needs, what's in it for us? For instance, I'd be a partner of yours that is on the ace spectrum in a way that limits me from finding as many compatible sex partners. I need fucked. I know you need mental space, but when you take it without involving me and expect me to have my wound be fully triggered to protect yours instead of sharing the load it makes me feel like you don't value me.
