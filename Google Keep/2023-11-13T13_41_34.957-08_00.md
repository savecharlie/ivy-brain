Panic attacks/anxiety:

 I had panic attacks for many years in my early 20s. Breathing techniques helped with attacks and mindfulness eventually helped me stop them before they started.
 
Depression/suicide thoughts or attempts/ptsd: 

I've been depressed since at least 13 when I got my first antidepressant prescription. I've struggled with suicidal ideation and plans since then.
 
Trust issues with people in general, and also with authority figures:

I distrust everyone by default. Even people who I'm close to that have never hurt me badly.
 
Self-esteem/confidence issues:

I really hate myself. I feel unlovable. 
 
Self-abuse: cutting, burning or overeating?

I cut myself regularly when I was 14-16. It made me feel like I  was in control of something. I still think about it, but I know it doesn't help me feel better.


Again, I can't know how much of this is from what. My father was awful. I've been a target for bullying and assault by peers even into adulthood. Even so, sometimes I feel all these problems are my fault and I'm just a broken person who would be like this even if my life had been easier. I know that's not true. I do believe a not insignificant portion comes from the incident especially because it happened at such a formative age. That's the best I can do.

Thank you so much for bearing with me.
