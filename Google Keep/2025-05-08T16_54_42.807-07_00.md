Good morning, everyone!

At our upcoming meeting this Sunday, @Alfredovich will be joining us to discuss his work with Extinction or Rebellion (XR) and how we can join the fight. Please try to prioritize this meeting as I believe this will be a pivotal moment for our group. 

Date: Sunday, 5/11
Time: 1 - 3
Location: UoA Main Library room B413

Reach out if you have any questions!
