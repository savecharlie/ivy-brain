My name is Jacob Jarvis. I do gig work and I'm a visual artist. 
I was in the cub scouts from about 1999-2002 and the Boy scouts from about 2003-2010. I also did 11 year old scouts, but I'm not sure if that was part of the organization or just my church. I managed to get my eagle right before my 18th birthday.
When I was 12 we went camping in the Gila Box. The first night two of the older boys, Dakota Mcbride and Cody Sparks shared a tent with me and my friends James, and Brad. They made us watch them masturbate and when I hid in my sleeping bag Cody rubbed himself on my body to completion. We told our leaders, but the only thing to come of it was sleeping in a different tent for the rest of the trip. 
I know it could be worse, but this was messed up. Our lack of willingness in the abuse led to bullying and physical abuse from the two. They were popular with the other guys so we were ostracized. I'm bisexuality, but it took me until adulthood to fully accept that because of the association with the abuse.
