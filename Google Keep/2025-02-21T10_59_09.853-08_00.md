In general I want to give you the space you need, but I didn't want to do that by compromising my emotional well being and I felt like I was

Did you actually want me or did you like that I wanted you?

I think we both sabotaged the relationship as a test. And the other person failed, but we both passed.

I don't need you to change. I think direct your attention and energy differently is different. It's asking you to be you but with a different vector

We're never going to be perfectly healed and ready for a relationship

If I was simply attached to you, I'd be afraid of losing you. I love you so what I'm afraid of is hurting you. And I love me. And myself.
 
I've been very focused on what I'm not getting that I imagine there's many that I'm not giving that I'm completely missing.

I realized I didn't need to want you anymore. I already have you. The love is always here.

We set out to do something different and sometimes we're bristling at things that feel unfamiliar

I love the man you are and long for the man you'll become at the same time.

I won't compromise my needs and boundaries. Make me want to be with you and I will.
