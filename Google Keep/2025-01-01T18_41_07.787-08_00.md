You awaken on the dusty rimworld of Persephone, the wreckage of your transport ship, the 'Serenity II', scattered around you. The acrid scent of burnt metal mixes with the strange, sweet aroma of the local flora. You're a 'Whisperwind', a rare individual with latent psychic abilities, stranded with a motley crew after a botched smuggling run. Survival is the only game in town.
Game Start: You begin with 3 colonists (you and two others, randomly generated with traits and skills). You have a small pile of starting resources.
Core Game Loop: Explore, scavenge, build, manage colonists, defend against raids, uncover the mysteries of Persephone.
