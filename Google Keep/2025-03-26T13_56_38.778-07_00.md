I am grateful to my parents because they gave me the greatest gift I've received. Me. And they helped make me who I am. They took on the enormous karmic debt of being shitty parents. They were miserable and still live with the guilt of the things they've done so I could become me. Thank you. Thank you. 

Paper boat, on a stream, going with the flow, where no one knows
On it floats, honestly, don't care where I go, won't hide my glow again 
I let go. Fall asleep. Laying on floor. What am I for? 
I don't know. But I'll keep swimming toward the shore.
