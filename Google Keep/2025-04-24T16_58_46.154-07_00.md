I can keep expanding my efforts towards being more regulated, but ultimately I can't promise not to have a trauma response and while I am the one that needs to do the work to stop her and clean up her messes, I can't be held responsible for things I'm doing in a dissociative state. That bitch has been known to say things that I do not mean whatsoever just to make people go away. Sometimes I watch it come out of my mouth from behind a fog and sometimes I hear about it later. I can keep trying, and learn new ways to do so, but I can't promise not to hurt you.

Something I think is important for you to understand is that I'm not saying your actions are inadequate to prove your love. I'm saying they're not fully sufficient in accomodating my attachment issues 

I hear you on the mush brain darling. I don't intend to overwhelm you. To be clear, I'm asking you if you're setting a boundary that I'm to leave alone for the day. I think that's what you were *implying*, but it would help me if you're more direct. Otherwise I'm walking on eggshells and assuming you want things you actually don't sometimes.

I also need you to know that when communication suddenly ends, that's a core wound trigger we haven't ran into much. I want to be involved in the decision of how long were choosing to cool off as opposed to being put in time out. I feel like I was responding to you and now I'm being shut down.

I feel like I was responding to you and now I'm being shut down. You said your piece. I feel frustrated I don't get the chance to reassure you as well.

I have hope that we'll get through this. I love you.

You said your piece and got to reassure me.
I feel frustrated that I don't get the chance to reassure you as well, especially now that I feel you're creating distance.

I'm being so good right now and it's because I value you.

I have hope that we'll get through this.

I love you.
