Things are easy when we're together. It's after when you push me away. It made me feel really shitty. It still does. Like my self worth isn't tied up in it, but it sucks that you don't see my worth. I wish you'd just give me the closure of saying you just aren't that interested. For me to be in a relationship like that would be abandone myself 

I'm willing to go slow. It seems like you want me. I think a good compromise is that we move forward with a more casual thing with the understanding that we're exploring the possibility of something more serious. I have not thought we were remotely there yet for the record. That should go without saying, but we do not communicate well. I think if you like me you should make me want to be around you. Like I do obviously, but taking it for granted hurts my feelings. Or if you're just not that interested , spare me the pain and say so. 

I know it seems like I'm trying to put things in a neat box labeled 'relationship', but I perceive you as trying to keep things in the neat box of friendship. There are no boxes.
