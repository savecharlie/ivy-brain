- [ ] Clean and Organize Bedrooms/Office/Studio

---

### Phase 1: Preparation & Mindset (Setting the Stage - High Impact, Often Low Spoon)

- [ ] **Create a "Landing Zone"**
    - [ ] Clear one small, uncluttered surface (e.g., a corner of a desk, a spot on the floor) in one of the rooms you'll be tackling. This is your temporary "clean zone."
- [ ] **Gather Supplies**
    - [ ] Find a large trash bag.
    - [ ] Find a box or bag for items to donate.
    - [ ] Find an empty laundry basket or bin for items that belong elsewhere.
- [ ] **Choose Your Starting Point**
    - [ ] Pick just one room to focus on first (e.g., your primary office area, one bedroom).
    - [ ] Within that room, choose just one small section, like one square foot of floor, or one small surface.

### Phase 2: Decluttering & Sorting (The Core Work - Spoon-Aware Micro-Steps)

- [ ] **Focus on One Tiny Area**
    - [ ] Commit to working on only the very small section you chose in Phase 1 (e.g., "this one square foot of floor," "this corner of the desk").
- [ ] **Handle One Item at a Time**
    - [ ] Pick up the very first item from that tiny area.
    - [ ] Decide its fate:
        - [ ] **Trash:** Put it directly in the trash bag.
        - [ ] **Donate:** Put it directly in the donation box/bag.
        - [ ] **Belongs Elsewhere:** Put it in the "belong elsewhere" bin (you don't have to move it yet!).
        - [ ] **Keep (Home):** Place it on your "landing zone" if it needs a new home, or directly in its designated spot if it already has one.
- [ ] **Repeat for the Tiny Area**
    - [ ] Continue picking up one item at a time _only from your chosen tiny area_ until that small section is completely clear.
- [ ] **Empty the Bins**
    - [ ] Once your chosen tiny area is clear, tie up the trash bag and take it to the main trash.
    - [ ] Take the donation bag/box to a designated "out-the-door" spot (e.g., by the front door).
    - [ ] Take the "belong elsewhere" bin to the next room and repeat the "one item at a time" process for _that_ bin, returning items to their proper homes.
- [ ] **Take a Micro-Break (Optional)**
    - [ ] When one tiny area is done, take a deep breath. Feel the satisfaction.
- [ ] **Move to the Next Tiny Area**
    - [ ] Choose another impossibly small section (e.g., the next square foot, the next shelf) and repeat the "Handle One Item at a Time" process.
- [ ] **Systematically Work Through the Room**
    - [ ] Continue this process, section by section, until the first room is fully decluttered.
    - [ ] When the room is decluttered, move on to the next room, repeating the process.

### Phase 3: Deep Cleaning & Initial Organization (Bringing in the Shine - Medium Spoon)

- [ ] **Clear All Surfaces (After Decluttering)**
    - [ ] Once an area/room is decluttered, remove any remaining items from surfaces (e.g., desk, shelves) to prepare for cleaning.
- [ ] **Dust & Wipe Surfaces**
    - [ ] Dust all surfaces from top to bottom (shelves, desk, furniture).
    - [ ] Wipe down hard surfaces with a damp cloth or appropriate cleaner.
- [ ] **Clean the Floor**
    - [ ] Vacuum carpets or sweep/mop hard floors in the now-clear room.
- [ ] **Create Designated Homes**
    - [ ] For items you decided to "Keep (Home)" that don't have a spot, consider where they truly belong.
    - [ ] Group similar items together and place them in their new "homes" within the room.

### Phase 4: Maintenance & Reset (Sustaining the Sanctuary - Low Spoon)

- [ ] **Daily "Reset" Routine (5-10 minutes)**
    - [ ] At the end of each day, spend 5-10 minutes putting things away that are out of place.
    - [ ] Clear your "landing zone" or desk surface.
- [ ] **"New Mess" Protocol (at Xerocraft or home)**
    - [ ] Remember: "Ivy only has to clean up after her new messes at Xerocraft." At home, aim to clean up immediately after creating a new mess.
- [ ] **One Item "Tidy Up" Trigger**
    - [ ] If you see one item out of place, commit to putting _that one item_ away. This often sparks further momentum.
- [ ] **Celebrate Small Victories**
    - [ ] Acknowledge and affirm each tiny step you complete. Each cleared surface, each put-away item, is a magnificent triumph.
