- [ ] **Pop!_OS Installing on External Drive** âœ… 2025-06-18
- [ ] **Boot into Pop!_OS & Test** âœ… 2025-06-18
- [ ] Create `client/src/lib/utils.ts`
- [ ] Install MIT dependencies: `npm install react-router-dom clsx`

### Update Imports & Deploy
- [ ] Fix all import paths for new structure
- [ ] Test locally: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Deploy to GitHub Pages
- [ ] Verify: https://savecharlie.github.io/flux/ shows React app

**Success Criteria:** Your existing components work in React structure

## Phase 2: Real AI Integration (The Make-or-Break Moment)

### API Setup (Pay-per-use, Code MIT Licensed)
- [ ] **Choose AI Provider:**
  - [ ] OpenAI API (GPT-4) - $0.03 per 1K tokens
  - [ ] Anthropic Claude API - Similar pricing
  - [ ] Both for comparison testing
- [ ] Set up environment variables for API keys
- [ ] Create `client/src/lib/aiClient.ts` (MIT licensed wrapper)

### Replace Mock AI with Real AI
- [ ] **Task Breakdown AI:** 
  - Input: "Research dissociative amnesia coping skills" 
  - Output: Actual smart subtasks, not mock responses
- [ ] **Daily Guidance AI:**
  - Input: All your tasks, memories, recent activity
  - Output: "Based on your patterns, focus on X today"
- [ ] **Pattern Recognition AI:**
  - Notices when you're stuck, suggests interventions
  - Learns your productive patterns vs overwhelm patterns

### Memory Palace Intelligence
- [ ] AI analyzes your memory entries for patterns
- [ ] AI suggests connections between memories and current tasks
- [ ] AI remembers context across conversations (like your Obsidian chat)

**Success Criteria:** Flux gives you genuinely useful guidance, not generic responses

## Phase 3: The Two-AI Telephone System (Advanced Cognitive Function)

### Deep Processing AI (Background Brain)
- [ ] **Unconscious Processor:** Runs analysis on everything you input
- [ ] **Pattern Engine:** Finds connections you might miss
- [ ] **Insight Generator:** Develops deeper understanding of your patterns
- [ ] **Context Weaver:** Maintains long-term memory across all interactions

### Flux Interface AI (Friendly Translator)
- [ ] **Loving Communication:** Takes deep insights and makes them gentle/actionable
- [ ] **Adaptive Responses:** Adjusts tone based on your current state
- [ ] **Therapeutic Guidance:** Frames suggestions in supportive ways
- [ ] **Progressive Revelation:** Doesn't overwhelm, reveals insights gradually

### The Telephone Game
- [ ] Deep AI processes everything in background
- [ ] Flux AI queries deep AI for insights
- [ ] Flux translates insights into loving, actionable guidance
- [ ] Multiple AI personalities can contribute different perspectives

**Success Criteria:** You feel like you have a wise, loving external brain that actually knows you

## Phase 4: Advanced Task & Memory Intelligence

### Smart Task Management
- [ ] **Spoon-Aware Breakdown:** AI recognizes your energy levels, adjusts task complexity
- [ ] **Context-Aware Suggestions:** "Based on your ADHD patterns, try this approach"
- [ ] **Next Best Move:** AI suggests optimal next action based on all context
- [ ] **Intelligent Recovery:** When you get stuck, AI knows how to help you restart

### Memory Palace Enhancement
- [ ] **Everything Storage:** Tasks, memories, insights, conversations - all remembered
- [ ] **Intelligent Retrieval:** AI finds relevant memories when you need them
- [ ] **Connection Mapping:** AI shows how current challenges relate to past experiences
- [ ] **Progressive Understanding:** System gets smarter about you over time

### Flow State Support
- [ ] **Energy Pattern Recognition:** AI learns when you're most/least productive
- [ ] **Adaptive Scheduling:** Suggests optimal timing for different activities
- [ ] **Overwhelm Prevention:** AI notices early warning signs, suggests interventions
- [ ] **Creative Flow:** AI recognizes and supports your creative processes

**Success Criteria:** The system actually helps manage your ADHD and supports your creative work

## Phase 5: Technical Architecture Completion

### Database (Echo Vault)
- [ ] **Local Development:** SQLite for testing
- [ ] **Production:** PostgreSQL for full memory palace
- [ ] **Perfect Recall:** Every interaction stored and retrievable
- [ ] **Smart Indexing:** AI-powered search and connection finding

### API Architecture
- [ ] **RESTful API:** For task/memory CRUD operations
- [ ] **WebSocket Integration:** Real-time AI responses
- [ ] **AI Service Layer:** Handles all AI provider communications
- [ ] **Background Processing:** Deep AI runs continuously

### Performance & Reliability
- [ ] **Fast Response Times:** AI responses feel conversational
- [ ] **Offline Capability:** Core functions work without internet
- [ ] **Data Backup:** Your memory palace is never lost
- [ ] **Scalable Architecture:** Can handle years of data

**Success Criteria:** Rock-solid external brain that never lets you down

## Emergency Shortcuts

### If You Get Stuck
- [ ] **Minimal Test:** Create simple React app that just says "Ivy Nexus Works!"
- [ ] **Gradual Build:** Add one component at a time
- [ ] **Mock First:** Use fake AI responses while debugging React issues

### If AI Integration Fails
- [ ] **Start Simple:** One API call that actually works
- [ ] **Debug Incrementally:** Test with simple prompts first
- [ ] **Fallback Plan:** Keep mock responses as backup

---

## MIT License Compliance

**Your Code:** All MIT licensed, completely open source  
**AI APIs:** Commercial services (OpenAI/Anthropic) - pay per use  
**Dependencies:** Only MIT-compatible libraries  
**Result:** You own your external brain, no licensing headaches

---

## Success Metrics

**Phase 1 Success:** React app loads, existing functionality works  
**Phase 2 Success:** Flux gives genuinely helpful AI responses  
**Phase 3 Success:** System feels like wise, loving external brain  
**Ultimate Success:** You have external cognitive function that actually works

---

## Current Focus

**Next Action:** Get React components live and working  
**Make-or-Break Moment:** Real AI integration in Phase 2  
**Core Goal:** External cognitive function that tells you what to do  
**Philosophy:** Promising AI + task management or bust  

**Remember:** This is important work, not busy work. Your external brain deserves to exist. ðŸ§ âœ¨
