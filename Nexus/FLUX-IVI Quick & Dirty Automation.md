## Phase 1: Hook Existing Tools Together ⚡ **QUICK & DIRTY**

### Use Existing Desktop Automation Tools ✅ ALREADY BUILT

- [ ] **Install Existing Automation Stack** 📦 2025-06-18
    
    ```bash
    # Pop!_OS built-in tools + a few extrassudo apt install xdotool wmctrl scrot tesseract-ocrpip3 install --user pyautogui pillow pytesseract requests
    ```
    
- [ ] **Test Existing Tools Work** 🧪 2025-06-18
    
    ```bash
    # Test screen capturescrot /tmp/test.png# Test OCRtesseract /tmp/test.png /tmp/outputcat /tmp/output.txt# Test mouse controlxdotool mousemove 500 500 click 1
    ```
    
- [ ] **Quick Integration Script** 📄 2025-06-18
    
    ```bash
    # Create ~/flux/ai-hands.py - ONE FILE that does everything# Uses existing tools, minimal custom code# Connects to FLUX-IVI via simple HTTP requests
    ```
    

### Browser Automation (Already Exists) ✅ READY TO USE

- [ ] **Use Browser Developer Tools** 🌐 2025-06-18
    - Chrome DevTools automation (already built-in)
    - Playwright/Puppeteer (existing libraries)
    - Browser extensions for automation
- [ ] **Quick Browser Control** 🎯 2025-06-18
    
    ```bash
    # Simple script that controls browser tabs# Uses existing automation APIs# No custom browser automation needed
    ```
    

### File System Automation (Built-in) ✅ EXISTING

- [ ] **Use Shell Commands** 🐚 2025-06-18
    
    ```bash
    # Let Python call existing shell commands# mkdir, cp, mv, nano, git - all already work# No custom file management needed
    ```
    

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:** Existing tools work together with minimal glue code

---

## Phase 2: Simple AI Connector 🔗 **MINIMAL CODE**

### One Python File That Does Everything

- [ ] **Create ~/flux/ai-hands.py** 📄 2025-06-18
    
    ```python
    # Ultra-simple script that:# 1. Takes screenshots with `scrot`# 2. Reads text with `tesseract` # 3. Clicks/types with `xdotool`# 4. Talks to FLUX-IVI with HTTP requests# Total: ~100 lines of glue code using existing tools
    ```
    
- [ ] **Hook to FLUX-IVI** 🪝 2025-06-18
    
    ```bash
    # Add one button to FLUX-IVI: "🤖 Auto-Implement"# Sends current instruction to ai-hands.py# Shows progress in real-time
    ```
    
- [ ] **Test with Simple Task** 🧪 2025-06-18
    
    ```bash
    # Try: "Open a new terminal window"# ai-hands.py should use xdotool to actually do it
    ```
    

### Existing AI APIs (No Custom Training)

- [ ] **Use Google Vision API** 👀 2025-06-18
    - Already trained OCR and UI element detection
    - Just send screenshots, get back element locations
    - No training needed - works immediately
- [ ] **Use Existing Instruction Following** 🧠 2025-06-18
    - Send instructions to Gemini/Claude
    - Ask for shell commands or xdotool commands
    - Execute the commands directly

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:** One script that can see screen and follow simple instructions

## Phase 3: Let IT Build The Rest 🤖 **AI SELF-IMPROVEMENT**

### Quick Dirty Version Improves Itself

- [ ] **Give AI Access to Its Own Code** 🔄 2025-06-18
    
    ```bash
    # ai-hands.py can edit itself# When it fails, it asks FLUX-IVI for better code# Automatically updates its own functions
    ```
    
- [ ] **Simple Learning Loop** 📚 2025-06-18
    
    ```python
    # When automation fails:# 1. Take screenshot of what went wrong# 2. Ask FLUX-IVI: "This didn't work, what should I try?"# 3. Update the code automatically# 4. Try again with new approach
    ```
    
- [ ] **Version Control for AI Changes** 📝 2025-06-18
    
    ```bash
    # Every time AI updates itself, commit to git# Can rollback if new version breaks# Track what improvements work
    ```
    

### Existing Tools Get Smarter

- [ ] **AI Learns Your Shell Commands** 🐚 2025-06-18
    - Watches your bash history
    - Learns your common patterns
    - Suggests/executes familiar command sequences
- [ ] **AI Learns Your Apps** 📱 2025-06-18
