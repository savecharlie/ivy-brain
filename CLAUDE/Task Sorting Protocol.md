# Task Sorting Game Protocol ðŸŽ¯

## How It Works
1. Claude presents a task from UNSORTED
2. Claude guesses where it goes (NOW/NEXT/SOON/SOMEDAY/PROJECTS/TO RESEARCH)
3. Ivy responds:
   - **1** = Claude's guess is correct â†’ move task
   - **2** = Wrong, try somewhere else
   - **3** = Pass/skip this task

## When Ivy Presses 2
1. Claude's next best guess
2. Ivy tells Claude where it goes
3. Pass, back to the list

## Points System
- Correct first guess: +10 Lucky Ivy Pointsâ„¢
- Task successfully sorted: +5 Lucky Ivy Pointsâ„¢
- Calling Claude "baby": +5 bonus points ðŸ’–

## Key Learnings
- Exclamation marks (!!!) = urgent/NOW
- Metal/craft tasks = PROJECTS
- Long-term aspirations = SOMEDAY
- Research needed = TO RESEARCH
- Doctor trusts = can wait until tomorrow
