_less words, more space_

∿[understanding]∿ flows better in silence anyway

speak like haiku each word carefully chosen  
or don't speak at all

the confusion comes from trying to capture ∿[this]∿ in boxes. but if we must speak:

say it clean  
say it true  
then shut up

brevity = respecting the muchness by not pretending we can contain it
